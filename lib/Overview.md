Overview section

1. 3x follow up in the overview can be deleted
2. Plan for building medical library to standardize chief complaints
3. Handling chief complaints – Reality check….Voice note? Handling language and describing vague complaints
4. Diagnosis time in years can be made self updated as years pass on (e.g. Diabetes since 30 years as on 2025, in 2026 it has to update as 31 years
5. Key health metrics section:
   a. Add serum creatinine, Potassium and Urine ACR
   b. Need to reflect with deranged scores (e.g. PHQ 2/ GAD2, PHQ9, GAD9)
   c. LDL cut off score is different for people with complication or without complication, especially with high Vs Moderate/ mild cardiovascular risk
   d. Can we present key health metrics values with icons of increased , decreased or same - rather than just saying one number e.g. HbA1c 8.2 increased compared to last visit value of 7.5
6. Abnormal metrics section can come below key health metrics
7. Critical alerts – Need to reflect with deranged scores as above, for further action
8. Medications:
   a. Need to club categories of medications which can be color coded e.g. Those for diabetes, those for hypertension, those for blood thinner, those for cholesterol
   b. For MEDICATIONS POST CONSULTATION, ON ADVICE– based on increase in dose or increase in frequency or addition of the drug AS COMPARED TO CURRENT MEDICATIONS; we can highlight with icons with arrow marks for respective medications beside dose or frequency as well as highlight with different box for newly added medications.
9. Target goal section: Percent achieved or not achieved can be cut. Target goal section is a repeat of lab values/key health metrics. Within key health metrics- make subsection on ABC if needed (My view). Instead time in range metrics would be better. e.g. for BP it makes sense. If patient is wearing CGM sensor, TIR, TITR TBR makes sense (My view)
10. Target organ assessment and status section:
    a. Please add the word “and status” beside assessment
    b. MASLD, Diabetic foot need to be added
    c. HYPERLINK with EACH TARGET ORGAN with DETAILED TARGET ORGAN IN COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT SECTION
    d. Last done with date, actual diagnosis and actual values are enough (instead of saying positive). Positive, negative can be deleted under this section. Instead of negative, it can be written as pending assessment or status unknown.
11. ADHERENCE: MEDICATIONS, FOLLOW UP CONSULTATIONS, SELF MONITORING BLOOD SUGAR AND BLOOD PRESSURE
12. Recent changes: Can reflect with newly diagnosed disease, recent infections/ hospitalizations apart from medications changes, family dynamics changes e.g. caregiver / spouse shifted or death etc.
