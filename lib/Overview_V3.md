Overview comments

1. Concise?
2. Data inputs: Define which fields filled/ sent/reported by whom? When? How?- From V6 screening document, starting two pages mainly and later screening questions
3. Chief complaints-
   a. Language option- English is fine, if patient doesn’t know English, would need assistant….Language translator or Bhashini product to be explored?
   b. Refine complaints: For every symptom – We need to have duration to be asked +/- site/ location, intensity etc need to be asked for specific symptoms such as pain….associated with any other symptoms
   c. Dictionary kind may be made- As they keep on typing or adding
4. Diagnosis summary:
   a. To add edit option
   b. If curser is placed near diabetes oral drugs, 3 groups, need to show which are those
5. Shift drug allergy or intolerance beside critical alerts
6. Key health metrics:
   a. HDL, TG, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12 can be deleted
   b. Add PHQ 2/9; GAD2/7 abnormal scores
   c. Add eGFR, calculated based on serum creatinine value
   d. Duplication to be avoided.
7. Abnormal metrics can highlight other metrics which are abnormal and may not be key metric. Key health metrics need to be those key metrics only (changes mentioned in point 4)
8. Medications and monitoring adherence need to be based on HbA1c values, target goals achieved or not. E.g. FBS, PPBS, BP, monthly would be enough if target goals are achieved. If not achieved, then Self monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) monitoring will be frequent, especially if on insulin. HENCE ADD FEATURE ON MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS. – MEDS, FOLLOW UP, BP MONITORING, BS MONIORING
9. Time in range: Key metrics: Trend analysis- Graphical as in lab monitoring for BP, FBS, PPBS, SMBG- Rest of the representation and points can be deleted
10. Medication timeline- Optional?
11. Medications management:
    a. Can it be viewed as in one page, rather than scrolling down? Very lengthy. Space can be reduced.
    b. First column disease condition, second column can have both medication with dosage
    c. Active can be green color
    d. Stop can be red color
    e. AI DECISION SUPPORT TOOL- MEDICATION RECOMMENDATIONS AS POP UP NOTIFICATION, AS PRECRIBED……ADD MEDSCAPE APP- DOWNLOAD, INTEGRATE…BUILD ACCORDINGLY
    i. Especially with high serum creatinine values, if eGFR is lower <60/45/30 etc will require dose modification or drug would be contraindicated or would require alternate drug
    ii. This has to be based on patient’s current status
    iii. E.g of Pop up notification, as red and blink: if eGFR is <60, Re review medications dose and necessity.
12. Target organ assessment and status:
    a. ADD NEXT DUE DATE FEATURE/ DETAILS…WHAT TESTS FOR NEXT FOLLOW UP
    b. IHD/HF- Add slash HF BESIDE IHD
    c. Diabetic foot covers indirect assessment of neuropathy and PVD. Hence can merge? Don’t make it separate assessments for neuropathy and PVD
