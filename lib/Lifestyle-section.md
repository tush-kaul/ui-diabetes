Lifestyle section (THIS NEED IN DEPTH MEETINGS- WHAT IS NEEDED, WHAT IS NOT NEEDED)
a. Patient’s lifestyle summary- one overview should be enough. Not so many tabs. e.g. These are the diet issues noted. This has to be presented in such a way so that it can be quickly addressed. Granularity need to be presented (Use LLMs to ask patients- say about carbohydrates etc)
b. This has to be very much simplified. Doctors may see only overview maximum. May be in depth for only nutritionists and lifestyle specialist
c. Diet: High fiber diet, Complex grains, Portion size as food plate principle, 4-5 servings of fruits and vegetables, appropriate timings of meals and snacks as check boxes
d. Physical activity—either step count/minutes of walk/yoga/meditation/any aerobic activity; Add strength training—number of days  
e. Habits section: Other than smoking and alcohol, to add substance abuse
f. Stress management can be retained here (Stress management elsewhere can be deleted to avoid duplication)
