Comprehensive assessment, status, action plan section (THIS NEEDS IN DEPTH MEETINGS WITH EACH SPECIALIST AND SUPERSPECIALIST- WHAT DO YOU DO TO ASSESS EACH, WHEN DO YOU TAKE ACTION, WHAT WILL BE THE ACTION, HOW DO YOU WANT TO VIEW, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO VIEW;;;;; RULE ENGINE- CUT OFF SCORES/VALUES/RESPONSE TO QUESTION)
a. Is this section needed at all? Instead can have SEPARATE TAB FOR ORDER TEST/INVESTIGATIONS AND SEPARATE TAB FOR REFERRALS
b. Delete skin changes, sexual health and autonomic neuropathy
c. Status of assessment: Last done with date; actual diagnosis and actual values are enough e.g. Moderate NPDR (instead of saying positive). Positive, negative can be deleted under this section. Instead of negative, it can be written as pending assessment or status unknown.
d. There is no need to have graph for which there are no values or if it is based on symptom questions- which can be categorical – yes/ no e.g., Neuropathy. It may be needed for those with continuous variable e.g. Nephropathy
e. Apart from subsections on investigations and referrals, add other options as “continue same” , optimize medications/ Add medications. “Continue same” because sometimes ECG changes or ECHO changes may not change and action plan won’t be there every time.
f. Can have feature for making “personal notes” (if any)- e.g. for neuropathy, if there is carpel tunnel syndrome and need to write referral to plastic surgery….then can write comments to plastic surgeon along with the referral. This can be more intuitive.
g. To add feature for drawing e.g. for neuropathy humanoid feature with shading option as drawn on the sheet for IP or OP patients
h. Follow up can’t be generalized
